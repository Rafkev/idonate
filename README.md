idonate application was created for a reading challenge to encourage teens and youth to read and learn about drugs, and addiction and help them find help. It was powered by #SayNo a non-profit organization that helps young people learn how to say no to pressures that come with their age.
I was privileged to write the code, and the book and also give a token to all the young people that participated in this challenge.
The reason for the reading challenge is that a lot of young people don't read and reading is one of the oldest and best way of learning.
The Application allows them to read, take a real-time test to test their knowledge of what they have read, and also
because of the feedback I got from those who read my book, I was encouraged to publish the book, and I was opportune it was accepted by Amazon.
